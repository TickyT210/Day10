               <p>The 1982 Trans am is one of my favorite cars. This car is special to me because of the show that my dad showed me from when he was a kid. Knight Rider. This show was amazing with is stunts and explosions and of course the cars. The Trans am has a 4 speed automatic with extreamly good handling. The top speed of the trans am is 201km/h (125mph) and hits 100km/h (60mph) in 9.7 sec. This car has been a top line want in my list.</p>

            <p>Yes. Another movie car BUT, I have my reasons. This car has a nice sleek design for a car in the 50's. The interior is amazing and the Size. I find that this car is a land yacht. this car is 209.5 inches (17.458333 ft) long. The car is from John Carpenter's Christine based off the Stephen King novel Christine about a killer Fury. The engine sound is amazing and I will talk about it on the <u>engines</u> page</p>

         <p>This car is a beast on the road. One of the most agressive cars I know. The fact that this is a vintage racecar makes it so much better. The grip that these tires have for this car is insane. The entire car has a clean design and has lots of power under that hood. This is probably one of the fastest cars in this list</p>

         <p>You just knew I had to through a Mustang into this list. The 1965 Mustang is probably one of the most famous ones here as this car has evolved into both ford and shelby for their designs. This type of Mustang was a cruising vehicle and had decent handling. </p>

The car itself wasn't the best but the car looked like it was from the future so it got popular and with the Back To The Future franchise, it got even more popular because everyone wanted to make it into a replica of the original time machine.</p>

         <p>This My dad's favorite car ever. My dad's dad had one of these when he was a kid and it got crushed by a moose. This car has got drag tune writen all over it. This thing could fly with correct tuning. Drag tires + Insanely powerful engine = fast car. This car stock has a sleek interior</p>

         <p>There is one of these sitting in my drivway right now. This is amazing vehicle that can go pretty fast. This car has a 4 speed automatic stock but can be swapped for a 6 speed manual if you want to. This car is just like the trans am just a bit less arrow dynamic. Our Camaro has racing tires so it has insane grip on the road. <sub>(My Dad Scares Me).</sub></p>
