               <p>Cars are one of the most used way of tranportation. The have powerful engines and special tires and such to help said vehicle with its actions. Trucks Have tailgates and all-wheel drive, while other cars are just to get from your home to someplace such as The Grocery Store. All of theses my have nice features but in most peoples eyes when the see a car that is older than them, they have to stare at it. It doesn't matter if your a car person or not. These cars (if take care of) can shine in the sun and look beautiful. These cars have loud and powerful engines. They can go pretty fast and look good doing it. This website will tell you some of my favorite cars, some i would like to own, nice looking ones and the specs. </p>
